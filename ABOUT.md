# About Prediction Accountability Platform (PAP)

## 🎯 Our Mission

**To democratize accountability in public discourse by creating a searchable, data-driven database of predictions and claims, enabling citizens, journalists, and researchers to expose bias, verify claims, and make informed decisions.**

## 📖 The Long Story: Why We Built PAP

### The Problem We're Solving

Every day, experts make predictions.

On television, a financial analyst confidently announces: *"Nepal's GDP will surge 7% this year."* On Twitter, an astrologer predicts: *"A major political shift in the next 3 months due to planetary alignments."* In a podcast, a political commentator claims: *"This party will win with 60% of the vote."*

These predictions influence people's lives:
- **Investors** change portfolios based on economic forecasts
- **Voters** make electoral decisions based on political analysis
- **Businesses** invest billions on growth assumptions
- **Families** make personal decisions based on astrology

Yet when these predictions fail, no one is held accountable.

### The Accountability Vacuum

Here's the harsh reality:

1. **No Follow-Up**: Predictions are scattered across dozens of platforms—Twitter, YouTube, podcasts, news articles, WhatsApp forwards. Once made, they're forgotten. In 6 months, who remembers what that analyst predicted?

2. **Selective Memory**: When predictions come true, claimants highlight them endlessly. When they fail, silence. This creates a **survivor bias** where bad forecasters maintain credibility.

3. **Hidden Bias**: A politician's advisor might have:
   - Predicted optimistic outcomes 100 times
   - Been right only 30% of the time
   - But still quoted as an "expert" on TV

   Why? Because no one tracked the full record.

4. **Misinformation Thrives**: In countries like Nepal, where media literacy is still developing, vague or false predictions spread unchecked. Phrases like *"things will get better"* or *"something major will happen"* are unfalsifiable and therefore unaccountable.

5. **Post-Truth Era**: With information overload, people can't distinguish credible experts from charlatans. Who's the better economic forecaster? No data. Who has the most accurate political analysis? Unknown.

### The Local Impact: Nepal's Specific Challenges

Nepal faces unique accountability gaps:

- 🗳️ **Election Predictions**: Every election, TV analysts make wildly different predictions with zero consequences for accuracy
- 💰 **Economic Forecasts**: Economists predict growth rates; actual numbers don't match. Which economists are reliable? Unknown.
- 🌊 **Hydropower Projects**: Politicians promise dam completions by specific dates. These miss by years, yet promises aren't tracked
- ✨ **Astrology Predictions**: Astrologers make personal and national predictions. While entertaining, they're rarely followed up
- 📰 **Media Literacy**: Nepal's media ecosystem is growing but faces challenges in fact-checking and accountability

**PAP changes this.** By making predictions visible, trackable, and verifiable, we empower citizens to demand better from their experts.

## 🌟 Our Vision: What PAP Enables

### For Citizens & Voters
Imagine you're an investor or voter deciding whom to trust. Instead of relying on reputation or charm, you can ask:

> *"What's this analyst's actual track record? Have their predictions come true? Are they overly optimistic or pessimistic?"*

Today: Impossible. Tomorrow (with PAP): Search their name, see their accuracy score (e.g., "65% accuracy rate"), review their past predictions, and decide if they're credible.

### For Journalists & Researchers
Instead of anecdotal fact-checking, journalists can use data:

> *"Economists affiliated with party X predicted growth rates that were off by an average of 2.1%. Economists from party Y were off by 0.8%. Let's investigate why."*

This enables deeper investigative journalism grounded in data.

### For Educators & Students
PAP becomes a teaching tool:

> *"Class, let's pick 5 political predictions from 2024 elections. Rate their vagueness (1-10). Now verify them against actual results. What patterns do you see?"*

This teaches critical thinking: skepticism, pattern recognition, bias detection, and how to verify claims.

### For Claimants (Experts)
Rather than fear accountability, good experts should **embrace it**:

> *"I'm confident in my predictions. Let me submit them to PAP so my track record is clear for everyone to see."*

Over time, **transparent experts gain credibility**. Accountable analysis becomes a competitive advantage.

### For Democracy & Integrity
At the macro level, PAP supports informed democracy:

- **Reduces misinformation**: Claims are verified against facts, not opinions
- **Exposes bias**: Systematic bias in predictions becomes visible
- **Enables accountability**: Public figures can't hide from their failed predictions
- **Promotes integrity**: When experts know they're tracked, they're more careful

## 💡 How PAP Works: The Mechanism

### The Core Loop

```
1. RECORD
   ↓
2. VERIFY
   ↓
3. ANALYZE
   ↓
4. PROFILE
   ↓
5. REPEAT
```

1. **Record**: Capture a claim anywhere—social media, news, user submission
   - *"Nepal's GDP will grow by 5% in 2025"*
   - Auto-score vagueness (1-10 based on specificity)
   - Extract: claimant, date, target date, category

2. **Verify**: When the prediction's date arrives, verify against reality
   - Did Nepal's GDP grow by 5%? (Check World Bank data)
   - Status: ✅ Fulfilled, ❌ Disproven, 🟡 Partial, ⏳ Ongoing, ❓ Inconclusive
   - Add evidence links (reports, data sources)

3. **Analyze**: Aggregate and spot patterns
   - "100 claims about Nepal's economy • 45 fulfilled • 35 disproven • 20 partial"
   - "Claimants from party A: 40% accuracy • Party B: 55% accuracy"
   - "Vague claims (8-10/10) are fulfilled only 20% of the time"

4. **Profile**: Build rich claimant profiles
   - Accuracy rate: 65%
   - Vagueness tendency (do they tend to be vague?)
   - Bias patterns (always optimistic on economy)
   - Category breakdown (better at politics than economy?)

5. **Repeat**: Continuously as new claims arrive

### AI-Powered Automation

To scale, we use **AI (Google Gemini)** to:

- **Parse claims**: Extract key details (dates, metrics, outcomes)
- **Score vagueness**: Use NLP to assess specificity
- **Monitor updates**: Scan news/data sources for resolution events
- **Suggest verdicts**: "Based on World Bank data, this claim is 95% accurate"
- **Detect bias**: "This economist has 15% optimism bias on growth predictions"

**But it's human-verified**: AI suggests, humans (community or moderators) confirm. Trust but verify.

## 🌍 Why Focus on Nepal First?

### Strategic Reasons

1. **Market Fit**: Nepal's media landscape is rapidly evolving. There's demand for credibility signals among voters and investors.

2. **Language Gap**: No comparable platform exists in Nepali. **First-mover advantage** in the Nepali-speaking world.

3. **Unique Topics**: Nepal's specific challenges (hydropower, elections, astrology culture) require a localized tool.

4. **Scalability**: Prove the model in Nepal, then expand to India, Bangladesh, Southeast Asia.

5. **Community**: Nepal's tech community is growing and enthusiastic about open-source projects.

### Cultural Relevance

- Astrology is culturally significant in Nepal; tracking astrologer predictions is novel and valuable
- Political accountability is a pressing issue; election predictions are highly relevant
- Economic forecasts matter to Nepal's growing investment community

### Technical Feasibility

- Smaller dataset to start (lower computational cost)
- Easier to source local claims and verify against local data
- Existing sources: Kantipur, Himalaya Times, Kathmandu Post, Nepal News
- Local population of about 30 million provides meaningful scale
